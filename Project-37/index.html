<!--Prompt: Weather Design

It could be a UI for a mobile app, a web app, or something completely different such as a weather alert widget. Consider its elements: city, temperature, forecasts, colors, weather icons/graphics, etc.
 
Is it being viewed on a smart watch or phone? Is it a weather warning for a storm or is it something unique such as something for a farm? -->
